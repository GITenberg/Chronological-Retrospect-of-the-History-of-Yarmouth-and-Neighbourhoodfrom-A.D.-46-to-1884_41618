3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Few words only are necessary to introduce this Third Edition
to our readers, beyond expressing a hope that the contents will
meet with general approbation, and that much pleasure will be
derived from its perusal, now and for many years to come.&nbsp;
We would ask, as a <span class="GutSmall">SPECIAL FAVOUR</span>,
in order to ensure a wider circulation, that our friends will
recapitulate the comments of the Press, by recommending this
<i>History of Yarmouth</i> as &ldquo;worthy of a place in every
library.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is seven years since the Second Edition,
without supplement, was published.</p>
<p>No greater honour could have been conferred upon the Author
than when the Heir Apparent to the Throne of England (His Royal
Highness the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales</span>, K.G.),
on his visit to Yarmouth in 1882, expressed his pleasure, through
Colonel Teesdale, in the acceptance as <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>a present, of a copy of this History;
and the placing of this work, with supplement (A.D. 46 to 1879)
in the principal stone of the New Town Hall in 1880 by the then
Mayor (C. C. Aldred, Esq.) was also gratifying.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Edward Birkbeck</span>, <span
class="smcap">Esq.</span>, M.P., writing to us from the House of
Commons, on March 19th, 1884, says:&mdash;&ldquo;I do not think
my name is worthy of having a book dedicated to me, but I shall
nevertheless be proud to have it placed where you
suggest.&rdquo;&nbsp; The people of Yarmouth will endorse our
sentiments when we say, for his zeal and untiring energy in
promoting many special objects in the &ldquo;good old
town,&rdquo; that he is worthy of greater eulogiums than we can
bestow, and therefore tender our best thanks to that gentleman
for his courtesy in allowing this volume to be dedicated to
him&mdash;a privilege that was also given us in a first issue, by
his predecessor in the Imperial Parliament, the lamented <span
class="smcap">Colonel Duff</span>.&nbsp; Neither must we forget
to express our obligation to a select list of subscribers to the
work.</p>

7</span>Crisp&rsquo;s History Of Great Yarmouth.</h2>
<h3>A.D. 46.</h3>
<p>The Romans entered this part of Britain when the valleys of
the Yare, Waveney, and Bure, as well as the sand-bank upon which
Yarmouth stands, were covered by the ocean.</p>
<h3>100.</h3>
<p>Burgh Castle, a Roman encampment, supposed to have been
founded.</p>
<h3>495.</h3>
<p>Cerdic, a Saxon Prince, and Qenrick his son, with five ships,
entered the port of Yarmouth and named in Cerdic Shore.&nbsp;
This Cerdic Shore seems to have been a great sand-bank formed
along the shore between two branches or channels of the Yare
called Havens, by which two channels the river entered the sea,
one running near Caister and the other near Gorleston.</p>
<h3>633.</h3>
<p>Between this and the year 640, a Saxon Monastery was founded
at Burgh, by Fursey, an Irish monk.</p>
<h3>870.</h3>
<p>Lodbrog, the Dane, driven by a sudden tempest from Denmark
across the sea, and, entering the Yare, landed at Reedham, where
the Court of Edmund, King of East Anglia, was then kept.&nbsp;
Lodbrog is said to have been received into Court favour, but was
soon afterwards murdered in a wood by the King&rsquo;s huntsman
(Bern) through jealousy.&nbsp; This led to the imprisonment and
execution of Edmund, and put an end to the Saxon dynasty in East
Anglia, after Hinguar and Hubba, two Danish chieftains, at the
head of 20,000 men, had ravished all East Anglia.</p>

went at a slow pace, and at the entrance of Regent Street were

execution; on his way thither he was perfectly composed, turning
from one side to the other, viewing the populace.&nbsp; After
ascending the scaffold, he spent some time in prayer, and when

strangling her with his hands, and not with a rope, as had been

which was the cause of his committing the murder.&rsquo;&nbsp;

under the step of the cell, and he would there find four
shillings and sixpence.&nbsp; A signal was then given, and the
unhappy man was immediately launched into eternity.&nbsp; The
body, after hanging the usual time, was delivered to the surgeons
for dissection.&nbsp; The gaoler, on his return, found the money
as described in the cell.&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
